## Drinks

[Bodega del Born](https://goo.gl/maps/rBhhUxQeNPtZcvKS9)
- A variety of vermouths to try

[Cala del Vermut](https://goo.gl/maps/xRCcYpLacgeWxS9A6)
- Our favorite vermouths we found in Barcelona

[Dux](https://duxborne.com/)
- Spanish-style gin and tonics
    - Don't get the cryo-infused gin and tonics. The taste isn't really changed
    at all, but it costs a lot more
